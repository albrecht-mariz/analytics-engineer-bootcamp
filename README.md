# Analytics Engineer Bootcamp

## Description 

This project focuses on utilizing dbt (data build tool) and Google BigQuery to create a robust data warehouse consisting of three essential layers: staging, dimensional model, and OBT (reporting layer). By leveraging dbt's powerful capabilities, we streamline the ELT process, enabling efficient data modeling and transformation. The staging layer serves as the foundation for ingesting raw data, which is then transformed and enriched in the dimensional model layer to facilitate analytical queries. Finally, the OBT layer refines the data for specific business needs, providing actionable insights to drive decision-making processes.

This project is part of the Analytics Engineer Bootcamp by Udemy.
